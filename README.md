# Part-3-XML-Programming---JAVA-or-Python-

-> Please download the files "Book.xml", "BooksSchema.xsd", "BooksDTD.dtd" that I submitted, on  your system for the "DomParserDTD.java" and "DomParserSchema.java" to run perfectly.
However,the running and output of both the DOM parser files have been shown in the Part-3 video I submitted previosuly through the college portal.

-> The "DomParserDTD.java" returns "true" when the validation of my XML document against DTD using DOM parser is successful.
   The "DomParserSchema.java" returns "Validation Passed" when the validation of my XML document against Schema using DOM parser is successful.

-> The changes(commits) I made to the files after the deadline is just deleteing the comments(which I had written for my clarity while coding) and clearing white spaces between lines of code for visualness so I hope you omit.
