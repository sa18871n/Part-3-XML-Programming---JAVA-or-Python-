# Part-3-XML-Programming---JAVA-or-Python-

-> Please download the files "Book.xml", "BooksSchema.xsd", "BooksDTD.dtd" that I submitted, on  your system for the "DomParserDTD.java" and "DomParserSchema.java" to run perfectly.
However,the running and output of both the DOM parser files have been shown in the Part-3 video I submitted previosuly through the college portal.

-> The changes(commits) I made to the files after the deadline is just deleteing the comments(which I had written for my clarity while coding) and clearing white spaces between lines of code for visualness so I hope you omit.
